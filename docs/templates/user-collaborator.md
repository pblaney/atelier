## Overview

Below are templates based on extent of permissions given to the user on the collaborator's side. Some example use cases would be:
- Providing a collaborator with access to exisiting data held in an S3 bucket to support transfer of data from you to them (one-way download)
>Use the 'Download only' template
- Providing a collaborator with access to an S3 bucket to support transfer of data from them to you as part of an ongoing project (upload and download)
>Use the 'Upload/Download' template
